This app is designed for people who want to use less plastic.

Enter any product name and see all the locations where you can find it plastic-free on the map.

It is based on user-generated content: when user finds new plastic-free product in some store - he can add its location to the database. 

Thus, only plastic-free products will be promoted with this app, making plastic-free lifestyle available for everyone.
